# aiken_primitive_types

In this project, we're taking a look into 10 Aiken primitive types, they're:

- [`Int`](https://aiken-lang.org/language-tour/primitive-types#int) - Aiken's number type. It's an arbitrary sized integer.
- [`ByteArray`](https://aiken-lang.org/language-tour/primitive-types#bytearray) - A ByteArray is an array of bytes.
- [`String`](https://aiken-lang.org/language-tour/primitive-types#string) - The use case for strings is extremely narrow in Aiken and on-chain code.
- [`Bool`](https://aiken-lang.org/language-tour/primitive-types#bool) - A Bool is a boolean value that can be either True or False.
- [`Tuple`](https://aiken-lang.org/language-tour/primitive-types#tuples) - Tuples are useful for grouping values.
- [`List`](https://aiken-lang.org/language-tour/primitive-types#list) - Lists are ordered collections of values.
- [`Option`](https://aiken-lang.org/language-tour/primitive-types#option) - Options are used in situations where you need optional values.
- [`Void`](https://aiken-lang.org/language-tour/primitive-types#void) - Void is a type representing the nullary constructor.
- [`Never`](https://aiken-lang.org/language-tour/primitive-types#never) - In some rare cases, it is needed to refer to an Option that can only ever be None.
- [`Data`](https://aiken-lang.org/language-tour/primitive-types#data) - A Data is an opaque compound type that can represent any possible user-defined type.
